    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Trello as my primary task managers for the past couple of years.  Recently, I found a very useful feature in Trello that helps me automating the creation of repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>This feature allows you to tell Trello to create a card on specified time such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am using this feature to create a few daily tasks that I want to do first in the morning such as meditation, coding exercise and learning chinese.</p>

<p>I am not a disciplined person and I found that this feature has been helping me forming new habits. I set it to put the tasks on the top of my todo list which makes it difficult for me to ignore those tasks in the morning.</p>

<p>Research says it takes around 66 days for a new habit to form. I suggest you to try this feature if you want to create a new habit and make it part of daily routine.</p>

<p>Check out this link for more details on how to use and set up the repeat card <a href="https://blog.trello.com/trello-card-repeater">https://blog.trello.com/trello-card-repeater</a></p>
